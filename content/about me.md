# __A little about me__

My name's Eduardo Galeano, I'm from Bogota Colombia and I'm a Systems and Computing Engineering
student by the time I write this post. Among my interests there are web developing, software
engineering, the Python language and I'm starting to take a look at AI. For my universitys
assingments I've made with the help of some friends a class streaming web page called
[UNplugged](https://github.com/Cegard/UNPlugged), another project I've made is called
[Firend](https://github.com/Cegard/firend) which is a thermal image analyzer to find forest fires
written in R and Python, the idea was developed with some friends.
